# reddit-my-palindromes-collector
Collects my own submissions and comments text to the r/palindromes subreddit

I will use this script to gather up the text of all of my submissions and posts (within the current year) to r/palindromes on Reddit.

I want to have a local text file containing a summary of all the palindromes that I have written, and posted to reddit.
